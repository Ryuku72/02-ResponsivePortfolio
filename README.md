Homework W2: Responsive Portfolio

## Aim // Introduction
To utilize Bootstrap and various tools learnt during Week 2 of Bootcamp to create a responsive website. References images were provided in the WAUS-CRAW-FSF-PT-02-2020-U-C-MW/ Week 2/ Day 1/ Homework folder. References images followed a 980px, 768px and 640px size variants.

### Buidling the Index page
Unlike the Week 1 Homework assignment we had to start from scratch and build a functioning and responsive website using all the tools learnt in Week 1 and Week 2. While in concept this was not difficult (cut and paste is your friend) the true difficult arose once I started to integrate Bootstrap. Majority of the time was spent using my Google-Fu skills to research, read and experiment. However, once I got the idea of the limitations of Bootstrap things became much easier.

### Using Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a preset cascade stylesheet that assists in the creation of grids, styles and offers a level of polish that can take years to master. The only issue, you can't mess with your own stylesheet too much. This is where I had the greatest amount of difficulty. For example, making the nav bar response at 640px was always hit and missing. It was not until i learnt the strength of 'inspect' that I truly started to understand what I needed to fix.

Then there was the responsive component of the background, the font and grid sizes. I still not happy with how things turned out and know I can do better with making things much better. Experimentation just took up too much time.

However, the grid system is very powerful and if anything I will be using Bootstrap at least to use grids.

### Pseudo and Experiments
To add a little flare to my I implemented the :hover pseudo affect to a number of links. I wanted this website to be very punk rock and slightly trashy on purpose. Font choices, layout and use of text was all intentional but I worry there are some areas where I didn't hit the brief because of design.

For example, the sticky header in the Portfolio.html is floating right, invisitble background and has a hover over affect. If I had made the footer visible and assigned a color then by design it would look out of place.

Failed experiments included changing images with media queries (using background-image) but that failed, trying to implement sub-columns and sub-rows within the design (didn't fit) and just trying out random effects with bootstrap.

### Cleaning up the code
This is somewhere I really wish I had more time. I am not happy with my final code layouts and lack of notes especially on the index.css. I need to manage my time better in this category. Furthermore, I started implementing response font towards the end of my assignment and never truly completed fixing everything.

However, I am happy to report that I did start creating certain habits later in the process which made cleaning up easier e.g. copying sections of the html, removing the details and keeping the heading.
